Current work on scripting the CFD process using Ansys Fluent
CFD of blood behaviour in an Artifical Heart using the Moving Rotor Method

Meshing
Uses geometry (.scodc) files. 
- see inputs.py for the params needed to create the mesh

Solution
will use SST- kw method


NOTES:
Code ONLY works on windows:
    - powershell: git clone repo
        - may have to specify the fluent installation location
